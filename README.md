- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolasmorenoy, I'm a civil engineer who is interested in developing structural design software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python but I'm aiming to become a software developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on civil engineer projects, but also in anything that seems interesting, I have always wanted to design my own robots.
- 📫 You can reach me if you like writing me an email at nicolasmorenoy@gmail.com
